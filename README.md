# Unsupervised-Decision-Trees

Data and code to support our paper titled: "Decision Tree Ensembles Utilizing Multivariate Splits Are Effective at Investigating Beta-Diversity in Medically Relevant 16S Amplicon Sequencing Data"
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.31.486647v2

# Input
    To run the code, you will need the following files produced by the MetaWorks (https://github.com/terrimporter/MetaWorks) pipeline: 
        1) The ASV table (ESV.table)
        2) The Taxonomic Ranks and Confidence Scores of Each ASV (rdp.out.tmp)
        
    In addition you will need the file containing the metadata.
    
    Also, please ensure that all paths are correct on your computer.
